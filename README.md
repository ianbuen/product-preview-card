## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned

This was an excellent challenge for me to apply and refresh what I know about CSS Flexbox. Combined with viewport breakpoints, using Flexbox is a powerful and effective way to a align HTML elements and to achieve the desired responsive layout overall.

### Continued development

I am aiming to be able to design responsive layouts much faster, to become more efficient when it comes to making use of responsive sizing, and to strive for better design practices all in all.
